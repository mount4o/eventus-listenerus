# eventus-listenerus
Simple event list Wordpress plugin written as a task for DevriX. 

The slug to the archive page with all published events is "/event". 

There is a custom "Event" post type. It has 6 custom fields:
  - An event start date ( works with a js datepicker script )
  - An event end date ( again - datepicker )
  - A text field for the event venue
  - A URL for the event/venues website
  - A field for google maps embedded html link to the location of the venue
  - A field for google calendar embedded link and button ( clicking it adds the event to your Google Calendar )
 
And here is picture of how published events looks like with a default Wordpress theme:
